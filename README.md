# SONY-VENICE-OCIO-Config
Based on the [LUT & ART Files | Sony Cine](https://sonycine.com/resources/luts/) I have created a minimal OCIO config of SONY VENICE for full CG projects. This is **the SONY VENICE 2 Workflow** in its most minimalistic and simple form:
* Inputs (textures) are in "linear"
* Rendering and Nuke working space are also in "linear"
* View Transform is for Rec.1886 display

There is no need to go wide gamut or do anything complex to **craft beautiful images**. Enjoy!

Original files (encoded in "linear-AP0") are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/fhzx0bcwcjylek1oz7kjc/ACGfmi0EHeufVOQPZLvvk7w?rlkey=53cp61955hbns8x46j6cf8k55&e=1&dl=0).

# About the config
* Reference color space is XYZ which is the base of all colourimetry
* "linear" stands for "linear_bt.709"
* "cineonlog_rec709" can be used for a matte-painting workflow in Photoshop
* "slog3_sgamut3cine" is the shaper space. It can be used for color timing and some operations (such as sharpen)
* Substance_painter roles were set following [this page](https://mrlixm.github.io/blog/substance-painter-color-management/)
* No inverse of the View Transform has been provided
* One may easily add several colorspaces or displays for HDR output if needed (such as "Rec2020_D65_PQ")

# Looks
* 36 looks from the [LUT & ART Files | Sony Cine](https://sonycine.com/resources/luts/) have been added to the config
* **BUT** they have been merged with the SONY VENICE View in a single LUT
* The use of Looks is highly recommended with SONY VENICE. I have set "SONY VENICE High Contrast" by default.
* To use one of the looks, you need to switch it with the one I left by default. Like this for instance:

```active_views: [SONY VENICE DD01 Classic FPE, Un-tone-mapped, Log, Raw]```
